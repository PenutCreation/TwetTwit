</div>

<h2 id="terms">General Terms of Service</h2>
<p>
Use of the Meko Media platform constitutes explicit acceptance of these Terms and all incorporated policies. These terms govern all interactions, content submissions, and account management on our service. Non-compliance with these provisions will result in necessary enforcement actions up to and including permanent removal from the platform.
</p>

<h2 id="privacy">Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>
Meko Media reserves the right to utilize provided user email addresses exclusively for critical communications pertaining to account security, service updates, official policy changes, or matters relating to ban appeals and legal necessity. We are committed to protecting user data integrity.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>User emails are utilized solely for account maintenance and security notifications.</li>
  <li>We will never access or modify user accounts unless mandated by emergency, security investigation, formal moderation appeal, or legal requirement.</li>
  <li>Data is managed in compliance with relevant data protection standards.</li>
</ul>

<div class="notice">
Meko Media prioritizes user security. If you suspect a security breach or unauthorized access to your account, please contact us immediately for investigation and remediation.
</div>

<h2 id="copyright">Crucial Policy: Intellectual Property & Copyright Infringement</h2>
<p>
The unauthorized submission, sharing, or distribution of copyrighted material constitutes a severe breach of our terms. We maintain a zero-tolerance stance toward users who knowingly disregard intellectual property rights, ensuring the protection of original creators and legal compliance.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>**Zero Tolerance:** Uploading or distributing content protected by copyright or trademark without explicit permission or legal right is strictly prohibited.</li>
  <li>**Consequence:** Individuals identified as repeat infringers or found guilty of uploading significant copyrighted material will face a **permanent account ban** without eligibility for appeal.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="exploitation">Crucial Policy: Database and System Exploitation</h2>
<p>
Any attempt to compromise the integrity, security, or stability of the Meko Media database, servers, or underlying infrastructure is considered criminal activity and a violation of the highest order. Protecting our system stability is paramount for the safety of all user data.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>**Prohibited Activity:** Any form of hacking, data scraping, unauthorized access, denial-of-service attempts, or any malicious exploitation of platform vulnerabilities.</li>
  <li>**Consequence:** Users found guilty of exploiting the database or infrastructure will be subjected to an **immediate and permanent ban**. Meko Media reserves the right to pursue full civil and criminal legal remedies against the perpetrators.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="safety">Crucial Policy: Prohibited Content (Pornography)</h2>
<p>
Meko Media is intended to be a safe and inclusive environment for a general audience. Content of an explicit sexual nature, including all forms of **pornography**, is strictly prohibited and will be swiftly removed.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>**Prohibited Content:** Posting, sharing, or linking to content that is sexually explicit, pornographic, or depicts non-consensual activity.</li>
  <li>**Consequence:** Any account found to have entered or distributed such content will be subject to an immediate and irreversible **permanent ban**.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="impersonation">Crucial Policy: Impersonation of Authority</h2>
<p>
Maintaining user trust and the integrity of administrative communication is critical. Misrepresenting oneself as a staff member, administrator, CEO, or any official representative of Meko Media is a direct attack on our community's trust structure.
</p>

<ul>
  <li>**Prohibited Behavior:** Falsely claiming to be an administrator, CEO, moderator, or authorized representative of Meko Media for the purpose of misleading users, soliciting information, or exerting undue influence.</li>
  <li>**Consequence:** This will result in immediate **suspension** and may lead to a **permanent ban** depending on the severity and intent of the deception.</li>
</ul>

<div class="warning">
Violation of any Crucial Policy (Copyright, Exploitation, Pornography, Impersonation) may lead to data retention for legal purposes and immediate, irreversible account termination.
</div>

<h2 id="enforcement">Rationale for Policy Enforcement (Why We List These Rules)</h2>
<p>
These stringent rules are not merely guidelines; they represent the foundational legal and ethical requirements for operating a public social media platform.
</p>

<p>
**Intellectual Property Protection:** We list the strict **Copyright Policy** to safeguard the legal rights of content creators. Failure to enforce these rules exposes Meko Media and its users to significant legal liability, requiring us to take decisive action against copyright violators to maintain our legal operating status and protect creative ownership.
</p>
<p>
**System Integrity:** The **Database and System Exploitation Policy** is listed to ensure the security, privacy, and functionality of the entire platform. Any attempt to exploit vulnerabilities jeopardizes the sensitive personal data of our entire user base. Permanent bans and legal action are necessary deterrents against cyber-criminal activity that threatens our operational existence.
</p>
<p>
**Community Safety & Legal Compliance:** The **Pornographic Content Ban** is implemented to establish Meko Media as a safe, legally compliant space suitable for all ages and demographics. This ban ensures adherence to regulatory standards regarding online content and promotes a community environment free from harmful, explicit material.
</p>
<p>
**Trust and Moderation Authority:** The **Impersonation Policy** is listed to maintain the integrity of platform administration. If users cannot distinguish official communication from fraudulent claims, the platform's ability to moderate effectively and guarantee user security collapses, necessitating severe penalties for fraudulent representation.
